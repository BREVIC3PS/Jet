# Phisical Jet project

![image](Demo/Overview.png)
This is a samll physical playground with some of my experiments. Currently there are is a physical jet and some other veihicles. In the future I may add more fun stuff here(or in other repos). 

# Demo

# Features
## Totally Phisically Simulated
![image](Demo/Fly.gif)  
Calculating all related forces, including Lift, drag, gravity, thrust, pressure-induced changes in lift, stall angle, etc.

## Stalling
![image](Demo/stall.gif)  
The physical airflow system enables an airplane to perform authentic maneuvers, including stalling.

## Explosion & multiplayer
![image](Demo/Explode&multiplayer.gif)  
The jet is both breakable and destructible, with all actions synchronized across all other clients. (Physics networked)

## Dynamic breaking
![image](Demo/Dynamicbreaking.gif)  
The jet can sustain damage from collisions or gunfire while in flight, leading to dynamically altered airflow and variations in control simulation results.

## Physics Asset
![image](Demo/PhysicsAsset.png)  
The configuration of physics assets will realistically alter the center of mass and affect the sensation of flight control.

# Thank you!
